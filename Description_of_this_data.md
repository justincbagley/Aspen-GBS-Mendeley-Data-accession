In support of the manuscript by Bagley et al. (in review; see below) on quaking aspen phylogeography and ecological niche modeling (ENM), this accession provides 1) code used to conduct independent runs of the TASSEL-GBSv2 SNP discovery pipeline (Glaubitz et al. 2014) on our final (combined) genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) dataset; 2) resulting SNP variant files from TASSEL-GBSv2 and final filtered variant call data files used during our genomic analyses; and 3) unfiltered vs filtered species occurrence data files and computer code used during our ENM analyses of our focal taxon, Populus tremuloides.
